### 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Building and maintaining high-performance backend services for warehouse operations and automation (order allocation, inventory/location lookups).
- Project lead for a Rust-based automated e-invoice service integrated with FPT Invoice.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Deepening systems-level Rust development and observability best practices.

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Backend systems (microservices, event-driven architectures), high-throughput data pipelines, and operational reliability improvements.

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Open-source examples of production-grade Rust patterns for async processing and retries.

### 💬 Ask me about
- Migrating monoliths to microservices, SQL Server → PostgreSQL migrations, event-driven order allocation, and designing low-latency master-data APIs.

### ⚡ Fun fact
- Built a high-performance game server backend and published events to NATS for async processing.

### 🔭 What I'm working on

- Leading a Rust-based e-invoice project (project lead, 3-dev team) to fully automate daily invoice generation and submission to FPT Invoice.
- Building high-throughput backend systems for warehouse operations: event-driven order allocation, location-inventory lookups, and system revamps.

### 🌱 I’m learning

- Advanced Rust for systems programming and production observability patterns.

### 💬 Things I can help with

- Migrating monoliths to microservices, SQL Server → PostgreSQL migrations, event-driven architectures, and optimizing low-latency master-data APIs.

### 📌 Selected highlights

- Rebuilt order-allocation service with **~90% faster processing** (event-driven; example: 200 orders allocated in 5s).
- Led migration **SQL Server → PostgreSQL** and redesigned services using **.NET 9 + Clean Architecture**.
- Delivered Rust-based e-invoice service; reduced runtime resources by **~90%** vs .NET and automated daily invoice submission.
- Implemented location-inventory service with **sub-150ms** lookups and strict service-level targets (master-data queries 1–20ms; specialized workflows <200ms).

### 🛠️ Tech & tools

- **Languages:** C#/.NET (Core, .NET 6/7/9), Rust
- **Architectures:** Microservices, Clean Architecture, Event-driven
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle
- **Caching / Search:** Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS
- **CI/CD & Infra:** GitLab CI, Jenkins, IIS
- **Observability / Logging:** Grafana, Loki, Graylog

### 🔗 Featured projects

- **E-invoice Service (Rust)** — Project lead. End-to-end pipeline (ingest → validate → store → submit → retry/monitor). Reduced human work and infra cost (~90% resource reduction).
- **Warehouse Revamp** — Led microservices migration (.NET 9), database migration to PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch ILM adoption.
- **Order Allocation (Event-driven)** — Replaced a slow synchronous flow with event-driven processing; improved throughput and stability.
- **Location-inventory Service** — High-performance lookup service for warehouse ops (sub-150ms).
